    desc: `Having strong, forward thinking leaders at the helm of a business is imperative, and online businesses are no exception. Growing virtual businesses need structured, high-level organization, leadership and creative problem solving on their virtual teams too!

The key focus of Leadership roles in an online business is to grow and scale the business. As a director or C-level executive on a virtual team you have direct input and influence on the direction and growth of the business. You also play a key role in inspiring, motivating, and modeling behavior for the team members that report to you. You have a phenomenal talent for leading by example and living out your company’s values everyday to ensure they’re at the forefront of every decision the business makes and every project the team takes on.

“Head,” “Director,” “Chief,” and “Vice President” are all parts of a job title that can indicate its nature as a Leadership role. There’s nothing like a front row seat to an online business’ virtual growth and success!`,

        desc: `In the first years of their online business it’s common for a CEO to be highly involved in the day-to-day operations. As their company grows, however, and often rapidly, they need to delegate some of their responsibilities to a Director.

As a Director in a remote team, you work closely with the CEO to oversee a specific department of the business in roles such as: Director of Operations, Director of Marketing, Director of Sales, Director of Finance, etc. Having you in their business allows the CEO to focus on the long term vision and strategy for the company as it grows. A Director may be promoted from within, or hired externally.

One of the first leadership-level hires an online business owner typically makes is in Operations. This could be a Director of Operations (Operations Director) or even a Chief Operating Officer.

Unlike an Online Business Manager (OBM) or Operations Manager, a Director of Operations is not in the weeds of project management. Rather, an Operations Director uses their expertise to hire and grow the virtual team, manages financial and legal aspects of the business, in addition to other key high-level activities essential to keeping the business in good health and growing.`,

Chief employees like you are the right hands to the CEO. You have a proven track record of leadership experience, and are able to guide high-level business decisions. C-level leadership will have an extremely high level of experience (we’re talking minimum years) in their field. An effective COO, for example, would typically have a combination of managerial or director-level experience in Human Resources, Operations or Finance, and have experience managing people and teams.

As with Director roles, Operations is typically one of the first key departments of focus when it comes to hiring C-level leadership in an online business.`,

You’ll need to be an experienced HR generalist or have a formal HR qualification to be in the running for this role. HR Support roles are mostly part-time or on an ongoing, contractual basis.`,
