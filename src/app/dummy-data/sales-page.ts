    title: 'What is a “Social Seller”?',
    desc: `A Social Seller is on the frontlines of an online business selling its product, service, coaching program, online course (the list goes on) via direct messaging on social media.  You will be responsible for initial outreach, fielding sales objections, managing a database of leads, and tracking prospects’ position in a sales funnel.

If you have sales experience and enjoy connecting with leads and solving their sales objections in real time, you could earn some pretty lucrative commissions. Not to mention, a stretched CEO or Administrative team member is usually in the DMs before social media sales support is hired - making a Social Seller a savior in many fast-growing online businesses!

Not all roles that involve “social selling” carry the job title “Social Seller”. Depending on your main job function, and what your company sells, these pajama friendly roles could have titles like Enrollment Specialist, in the case of an education-based company, or Product Specialist, in the case of an eCommerce business that sells a physical product.
